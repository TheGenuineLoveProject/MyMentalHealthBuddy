# MMHB System Architecture & External Dependencies

This document holds the narrative architecture description and external-dependency manifest, extracted from `replit.md` on 2026-05-15 in v5.8.89 to keep the active context lean. For active governance (User Preferences, Governance Kernel, Universal Contracts, Polish & Feature History) see `replit.md`. For per-version detail see `docs/changelog.md`.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend features a Canva-inspired design using HSL color formatting, custom typography, enhanced gradients, and refined shadows, with an "Aurora Token System" for light/dark themes and WCAG AA accessibility. A "Buddy Engine" provides a visual companion. The Lumi Design System v2.0 offers an additive visual system with new tokens, typography, dark-mode mapping, and brand assets including a mascot. The platform includes five additive React pages for Discernment, Protocols, Biometrics, and Admin, two marketing pages, and a public tools directory. Eight interactive, client-side wellness tools are provided, each with crisis links and accessibility features. Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Technical Implementations
The project uses a monorepo architecture with React 18 (TypeScript, Vite) for the client and Node.js/Express (TypeScript) for the server, offering a RESTful API with security and session management. It features a trauma-informed NLP layer and a "Wellness Microcopy Library." A Dual-Engine AI Prompt Architecture separates user-facing and administrative engines. Core orchestration includes RBAC, crisis-first intent routing, PII redaction, structured event logging, and a Self-Tuning Fallback Library. The system performs subtle-emotion inference, adaptive response policies, an intervention module router with eight evidence-backed modules and seven micro-exercises, and a `user_feedback` signal-capture loop. Unified crisis detection short-circuits to appropriate responses.

An "Awareness Detection Pipeline" uses a three-layer ensemble (RuleMatcher, MLClassifier stub, LLMReasoner) for detecting manipulation, distortion, and fallacies, integrating with the AI chat. An "Agent Orchestrator" is a pure-JS deterministic state machine for AI agent invocation, with actions recorded in an audit log and a three-tier memory abstraction (Hot, Warm, Cold). "Consciousness OS Foundation Primitives" establish persistence and audit with Drizzle tables.

A "Biometric Ingestion Pipeline" adds opt-in nervous-system telemetry, encrypting data at rest and supporting OAuth integrations. The "Discernment Tutor" is an awareness-training belt ladder over the awareness detection pipeline, using scenario-based lessons. The "Protocol Execution Engine" is a deterministic state-machine walker over therapeutic-protocol DAGs, seeded with ten evidence-informed protocols. An SEO content generation script drafts trauma-informed blog posts.

### Feature Specifications
Core features include AI-powered Chat Therapy, Wellness Tools (State Tracker, Journal Prompts), and specialized APIs. The platform supports a four-tier subscription model and includes security features like rate limiting, CSP, and input sanitization. Engagement tools comprise gamification and a Content Studio. User features offer daily healing reminders, voice affirmations, and an AI companion. Admin tools provide dashboards and an "Admin Command Center" with an "SOP Monitor." The `/growth` page serves as a "Metacognition Mirror," and the "Peace Scape" surface provides a sanctuary environment.

Both chat surfaces (`AIChatPage.jsx`, `AIChatPanel.tsx`) display the canonical Lumi mascot avatar on assistant bubbles and typing indicators (with `lumi-breathe` motion and graceful `onError` fallback). The home footer surfaces Home, About, Tools, Wisdom, Blog, Newsletter, Disclaimer, Privacy, Terms, and Crisis routes through its 4-column block plus the `SafetyFooter` strip. Signup-intent CTAs route to `/register`; "Sign In" buttons remain on `/login`. The canonical Lumi mascot lockup uses a soft sage radial halo across all auth and landing surfaces. The `/chat` surface renders a top breadcrumb nav with **Back to Dashboard**, Home, Journal, Mood, and a right-aligned rose **Crisis Support** link.

### System Design Choices
Drizzle ORM is used with a Neon PostgreSQL database. Production security includes CORS allowlisting, JWT authentication, Helmet, and rate limiting. An observability layer provides health and system endpoints, utilizing OpenTelemetry tracing and PagerDuty alerting. A `Prompt-OS Execution Prompt Library` ensures canonical prompt modules. Production readiness features include a 503 readiness gate, health probes, telemetry parity, request tracing, and hardened administration access governed by a `CHANGE_GATE` protocol. The platform includes a layered self-healing stack for automated monitoring, diagnosis, and repair. Autoscale deployment uses split build/run phases to optimize cold-start times. The system AI prompt is extended with governance sections for canonical domain classification, UX contract integration, tone guidelines, a reflection prompt library, a Therapeutic Framework Reference Library (Motivational Interviewing, Active Listening, Validation Support, Rapport Building, Metacognition Prompts, Belief Exploration, Emotion Processing, Strength-Based Coaching, NLP-Informed Communication, Safety Boundaries) with an explicit hard rule against framework-name leakage to users, and crisis escalation protocols. Admin panels are wrapped in `<SafeBoundary>` for error isolation.
