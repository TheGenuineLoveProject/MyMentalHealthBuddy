# MyMentalHealthBuddy by The Genuine Love Project

## Overview
MyMentalHealthBuddy (MMHB) is an AI-powered mental wellness platform by The Genuine Love Project. It aims to foster self-love, healing, and emotional growth through AI-assisted guidance, mood tracking, journaling, and crisis support. The platform integrates AI with trauma-informed psychological principles to provide ethical, accessible, and personalized mental health support globally, striving to reduce stigma and empower individuals.

## User Preferences
- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language
- Engineering standards: A→Z 360° complete solutions
- Mental health approach: Trauma-informed, supportive, non-clinical language
- UX philosophy: Gentle, compassionate, accessible
- DRY-RUN FIRST
- Non-destructive (never delete without permission)
- Educational only (no diagnosis, no treatment claims)
- Original writing only
- WCAG AA accessibility
- Calm, consent-based language
- Always include /crisis routing on wellness content
- Replit-safe execution only
- If unsure, ask ONE clarifying question. Never guess.

## Governance Kernel — MMHB v7.4 (Locked 2026-05-06)
All AI-assisted development is governed by the **MMHB v7.4 Archival Kernel** at `docs/governance/MMHB_v7.4_ARCHIVAL_KERNEL.md`. Key contracts:
- **Primary Law:** Business logic never appears in healing flows; healing responses never contain pricing, conversion, or platform debugging.
- **Domain routing:** Every request classified as HEALING / BUSINESS / PLATFORM before solutioning. Cross-domain contamination is a critical failure.
- **Engine model:** Smallest valid engine wins (CSS fix > React patch > new component > new page > new service).
- **BHCE:** Crisis escalation overrides all rules; explicit self-harm signal → 988 + Crisis Text 741741 + 911 + `/crisis`. Asymmetric risk: err toward resource provision.
- **Execution discipline:** Diagnose with evidence → smallest patch → screenshot verify → build check → next blocker. Never skip verify, never multi-blocker, never proceed past a failed gate.
- **Replit mode:** Shell for mechanical work, AI for logic only, adapter mode (preserve structure, thin wrappers, zero breaking changes).
- **Output contract:** What changed (files+lines) / Before / After / Build status / Next step. No speculation, only verified fixes.
- **Circuit breaker:** Same bug recurring 3× after fix → architectural review, not another patch.

## Polish & Feature History

**Archive notice:** Entries older than v5.8.100 removed to keep this file lightweight. Entries v4.1.1 → v5.8.99 archived to `docs/replit-history.md`. Full deep-technical detail for every release lives in `docs/changelog.md`.

### Index (v5.8.100 – v5.8.137) — archived

The full verbatim Index rows for v5.8.100 → v5.8.137 have been moved to `docs/replit-history.md` (section "v5.8.100 – v5.8.137") by H1 cycle on 2026-05-17 to relieve `replit.md` size pressure. Active runtime references and canonical governance contracts remain below. Deep-technical per-version detail continues to live in `docs/changelog.md`.

### Part B — Portal Token Audit (CLOSED)

- **Status:** NO-OP — deferred caveat moot
- **Finding:** Zero portal mounts in codebase (0 `createPortal`, 0 Radix UI, 0 Dialog/Toaster/Tooltip)
- All modals/dropdowns render inline in React tree — already inherit `.hxos-vnext` tokens via Phase 2-5 page wraps
- Architect deferred caveat closed by audit — no edits needed

### Universal contracts

Every polish layer above honors these (and any new layer must too):

- Scoped under a unique `.{name}-polish` wrapper class — zero leak risk.
- All accent / aura / particle / glow color values drawn from the canonical 8-hex brand palette (sage `#A8C9A0`, sunshine `#FFD93D`, blush `#FF9A8B`, calm-blue `#74C0FC`, empathy-purple `#C8B6FF`, mint `#A8D5BA`, warmth-orange `#FFB88C`, heart-amber `#E8913A`). Neutral base RGBAs (cream / white / black with low alpha) permitted only for ambient overlays, drop-shadows, and ring-on-white outlines, never as a brand accent.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` blanket: particles `display:none`, animations/transitions killed, transforms pinned.
- Z-index contract: decorative layers 0/1/2 → content `relative z-10`.
- Crisis routing (`/crisis`, 988, 741741) preserved on every wellness surface.

For complete per-version detail → `docs/changelog.md`. For Quick Reference (build/tsc/bundle commands + opt-in module import patterns) → `docs/architecture.md` (Quick Reference appendix).
