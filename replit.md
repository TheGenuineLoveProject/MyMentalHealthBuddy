## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend features a Canva-inspired design with HSL color formatting, custom typography, enhanced gradients, and refined shadows. It supports light/dark themes, micro-interactions, and WCAG AA accessibility through a design token system ("Aurora Token System"). The "Buddy Engine" visual companion renders alongside the AI Chat orchestrator, featuring a screen-face robot design with state-driven visual changes. The landing page uses an NLP-informed emotional journey structure. A reusable `glp-pane` primitive ensures consistent UI element styling.

### Technical Implementations
The project uses a monorepo structure with React 18 (TypeScript, Vite) for the client and Node.js/Express (TypeScript) for the server, offering a RESTful API with security and session management. It features a trauma-informed NLP layer and a "Wellness Microcopy Library." A Dual-Engine AI Prompt Architecture separates user-facing and administrative engines with strict data boundaries, supported by a self-evolving prompt registry. Core orchestration includes RBAC, crisis-first intent routing, PII redaction, structured event logging, and a Self-Tuning Fallback Library for offline scenarios. The system incorporates subtle-emotion inference, an adaptive response policy, an intervention module router with eight evidence-backed modules and seven micro-exercises, and a lightweight `user_feedback` signal-capture loop. Crisis detection is unified and short-circuits to appropriate responses. The application bootstraps its database schema at boot. Authentication handles user registration and login, storing JWTs in local storage and ensuring CSRF exemption for specific auth endpoints. An Admin Command Center provides an operations console with strict authentication and authorization for administrative tasks.

### Feature Specifications
Core features include AI-powered Chat Therapy, Wellness Tools (State Tracker, Journal Prompts), and specialized APIs. The platform supports a four-tier subscription model and includes security features like rate limiting, CSP, and input sanitization. Engagement tools comprise gamification and a Content Studio. User features offer daily healing reminders, voice affirmations, and an AI companion. Admin tools provide dashboards, and content is organized via a Learning Hub. The `/growth` page serves as a "Metacognition Mirror," displaying user tenure, mirror stats, dominant feelings from journal data, metacognitive invitations, and dynamic milestone cards. The "Peace Scape" surface (`/peacescape`) provides a sanctuary environment. A `CustomizerPanel` allows authenticated users to save personalization choices, with guests able to preview locally. An `InteractiveBuddy` wrapper enables users to cycle through positive expressions. An additive admin panel, "SOP Monitor," proves every feature works entry→process→output→verify→evolve, with a single source of truth at `docs/SOP_FEATURE_MAP.md`.

### System Design Choices
Drizzle ORM is used with a Neon PostgreSQL database. Production security includes CORS allowlisting, JWT authentication, Helmet, and rate limiting. An observability layer provides health and system endpoints. A `Prompt-OS Execution Prompt Library` ensures canonical prompt modules validated against `promptspec.schema.json`. Production readiness features include a 503 readiness gate, health probes, telemetry parity, request tracing, and hardened administration access governed by a `CHANGE_GATE` protocol. The platform includes a layered self-healing stack for automated monitoring, diagnosis, and repair, accessible via admin endpoints and including AI-driven diagnosis. Direct-routed public pages use the `PageLayout` wrapper for consistent navigation and safety footers.
